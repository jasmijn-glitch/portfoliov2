    <h1>Astro charts</h1>
    <p>Astro charts is an application that will help users to understand reading natal birth charts, in a very broad way.<br> 
        <br>
        I came up with this concept because in my opinion there is no app that teaches you about astrology like this one. Because users can interact with the chart wheel, they will most likely remember their placements better, as well as the information that goes with it.<br> 
        <br>
        When you click on for example the moon, you not only get information about your moon sign, but also about the house that it is in, and the aspects that your moon is making relating to other planets, which are far more important in astrology.<br>
        <br>
        Astrology apps nowadays mostly only focus on the sign the planet is in, and sometimes the house. But the way the information is displayed can be very confusing.<br>
