    <h1>Destination unknown</h1>
    <p>This is a design rationale for my school project: Destination unknown. The most important parts of my research are in here, as well as the most important functionalities explained. <br> 
        <br>
        Destination unknown is for travelers who are longing for an adventure based on their own preferences. The ultimate goal is to make travelers have faith in the unkown, because that's where the real adventures lies. Whenever you take a trip without expectations, it can turn out to be one of the most amazing trips of your life. This adds a whole new layer of possible experiences to the user and their travel journeys.<br> 
        <br>
        The web-app uses surveys to generate possible locations for the user, and the locations are accessible trough google maps for easy use. You have two options on the platform: Connect & Wander<br>
        <br>
        Connect is to look for fun events, most likely to be in the city. Good option to meet new people or visit a party or workshop. <br>
        <br>
        Wander is to get lost in nature, visiting beautiful spots that are not crowded with tourists.
